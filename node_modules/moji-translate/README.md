## emoji-translate

You know how sometimes you type English and it has all these letters and words and no emoji? Yeah, emoji-translate fixes that.

## Sample demo
![omg emoji](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1369170/8635052/e333474e-27c7-11e5-8af8-5b0bc2281095.gif)

This is what you actually want, right? Can't blame you. [Here](http://meowni.ca/emoji-translate) you go. üëè

## As a library
You can also use this as a standalone library for your own translation purposes.

### Install
```
npm install moji-translate
```

### Usage
```
translate = require('moji-translate');

console.log(translate.getAllEmojiForWord('üëÄ'));
console.log(translate.translate("the house is on fire and the cat is eating the cake"));

```

The `emoji-translate` api has 5 methods:

  * `isMaybeAlreadyAnEmoji` -- returns true if a character is already an emoji
  * `getAllEmojiForWord(word)` -- returns a list of possible emoji translations
  * `getEmojiForWord(word)` -- returns a random translation from the list
  returned by `getAllEmojiForWord(word)`
  * `translate(chunk, onlyEmoji)` -- returns a translation of the whole chunk of text. If `onlyEmoji` is true, then the untranslatable words are removed
  * `translateForDisplay` -- calls `translate` but returns a `<span>` element that contains either the original word, or the emoji translation, ready for display (either as a span, or a `<select>` if multiple translations are
  available)

## Chrome extension
There's also a Chrome  [extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/emoji-translate/kkkfndlpdajmbgofkidemhkjoinhmojl) that lets you translate any page on the internet to emoji. Your nightmares are finally over.
